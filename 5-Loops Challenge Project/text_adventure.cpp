Module 5: Loops Chanllenge Project
Project: Build Text Adventure
*/

// Project Goals: Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. The program should use your knowledge of C++ conditionals, logic, and loops.

/* Project Requeriments:
    1. A storyline with: a beginning and at least three possible endings
    2. At least three branch points where the user must make a choice about what to do next: give the user at least two choices and accept user input.
    3. incorporate at least one kind of loop: 
    to validate user input (e.g., check if the user entered something other than your listed choices and then list the choices again), to give the user multiple chances to choose a specific outcome (e.g., give a user three chances to pick an option that wonâ€™t get them killed), to continue the adventure until the user makes a particular choice
    4. should handle user choices using conditional logic.
    5. Optional: Add ASCII art.
